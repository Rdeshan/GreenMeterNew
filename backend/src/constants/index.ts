      task: `
      Using the provided device data, calculate total energy usage in kilowatt-hours (kWh) = (consumption × total_hours) ÷ 1000, where total_hours = hours + (minutes / 60). 
      Then produce structured recommendations divided into sections: 'tips' (general efficiency advice), 'improvements' (specific device-based suggestions), and 'warnings' (potential overuse or inefficiency risks).
